next set of updates

future updates

there is exactly one geotech used by most of the local property devs. my PM also recommends him, apparently the council loves him. 

viewed a bunch of houses, like, 7 of them, and then I finished out my 16 hour day by writing up notes and stuff to send to builder. turns out my initial stack ranking of houses was...pretty good actually, but there were a few surprises. there's a broker. one of the vendors has Opinions on house movers. that was a really long day. it comes down to 3 options, we'll say. getting builder to weigh in. and expert advice. also I learnt what exactly akl council is doing. 

that all happened on settlement day, no muss no fuss, now I have an invoice from the independent trustee. 

formally engaged a local PM experienced in similar projects, to handle coordinating all the various people who need to make site visits. 

builder sent me back opinions and ballpark prices for my top ranked houses. added to PPTCAD and made a final selection. it's a 3br house about 100m2 that will be renovated to have 2 toilets. (this is true of all the houses in the final top 3 selection, actually.) 

also I found people listing secondhand cabins on TM and FB, you just have to wade through the shit. but cabin decision comes after house decision. 

also also put numbers through and now I have a decent estimate of expected spending until piles refinance time. 

this has been a really long week I'm so glad I have a PM
