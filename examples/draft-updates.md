# Team

I wouldn't be anywhere without Wayne from iFindProperty. Thanks for introducing me to Ian from WOW Renovations too. Wow indeed. 

Craig at Kiwibank lives up to his bio on the website. 

Chris, the #1 house insurance guy in NZ, needs no introduction from me and I'll recommend him to everyone all day. 

The good folks at SWDC have been all in from day one. 

Looking forward to working with Fiona from RentAssured. 

Upcoming: surveyor, house mover, assistant...
