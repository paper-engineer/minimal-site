# Signing

It's almost official, I have signed the paperwork to settle. 

# Insurance 

I love my insurance broker! He has such lovely inside knowledge like "insurers are getting reluctant to cover relocatables now, unless you have existing business with them". That, and the comparison documents, and even more inside knowledge around insuring cabins of the almost-self-contained variety. 

# Meeting with Council...as expected

I had such high hopes, you know? Arranged a meeting with the engineer, planner and someone from the building consents team. Only the planner turned up - at a meeting which the time was set by the engineer! 

Got some usable info around subdivision, at least, but nothing immediately actionable. Now to chase all my required info via email. 

## Everything but the kitchen sink

I'm told council considers the kitchen sink to be the difference between a self-contained unit and not. TBC how that plays with insurance, but there are options. Have I mentioned I love my insurance broker?

# Team

I wouldn't be anywhere without Wayne from iFindProperty. Thanks for introducing me to Ian from WOW Renovations too. WOW, indeed. 

Craig at Kiwibank lives up to his bio on the website. 

Chris, the #1 house insurance guy in NZ, needs no introduction from me and I'll recommend him to everyone all day. 

The good folks at SWDC have been all in from day one. 

Looking forward to working with Fiona from RentAssured. 

Upcoming: surveyor, house mover, assistant, geotech...
