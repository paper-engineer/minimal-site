house list

fenton hhr248

whatever pbrs I emailed out to candice

rhl has two total between their tm and website

wbr has a grand total of zero suitable, wtf

cwbr listings are plus gst and seems relatively expensive - suitable houses - owen at 100k, eve at 95k, ollie at 69k, susie at 95k - nope I don't think I can get good value out of it

bop209 archie, if nothing else, but I think pbr has better

trh: 15 kinloch is a bit small but it fits, 24 glenfield perfectly dimensioned barely needs updating https://trhco.co.nz/properties/24glenfield/ it's like the private sale one but better, 8 blockhouse bay has some potential but small, 16 highland park isn't terrible but doesn't win awards, 18 avondale https://trhco.co.nz/properties/18avondale/ but try for house-only, and whatever was on my trademe watchlist
